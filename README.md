# Knight's Logic
Knights moves:

Knight can only move in a L direction(meaning if movement on X-axis(xMovement) == 1, then the movement on Y-axis(yMovement) == 2 (must) and also the other way around.

Also, We need to check the square that we are moving to and make sure that if there is a piece present that its not our own piece.

# Bishop's Logic
Bishop's moves: 

The bishop may move any number of squares on the same colured squares in a diagonal direction until it is prevented from continuing by another piece. It may then capture the opposing piece by landing on the square.
Bishop can't jump pieces unlike Knight.
