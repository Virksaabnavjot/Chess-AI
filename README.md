# Implementing Knights Logic
Knights moves:

Knight can only move in a L direction(meaning if movement on X-axis(xMovement) == 1, then the movement on Y-axis(yMovement) == 2 (must) and also the other way around.

Also, We need to check the square that we are moving to and make sure that if there is a piece present that its not our own piece.
